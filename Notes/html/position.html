What is Position property in CSS?
=================================
    - The CSS position property is used to define the position of an element on a webpage.

    - The location of the positioned element is set with the four properties:
        - top
        - right
        - bottom
        - left

    The position property has the following five values:
        1. static
        2. relative
        3. absolute
        4. fixed
        5. sticky

    1. CSS static Position
    =======================
        - The static value of the position property allows elements to be positioned accordingly to the normal flow of the document. 
        - The static position is not affected by the top, right, bottom, and left values.
    Note: The static value is the default value for the position property.

    2. CSS Relative Position
        - The relative value positions the element relative to the original position in the document. 
        - The element is positioned with the top, right, bottom, and left values.
        Note: The space is preserved in the original position of the element.
    3. absolute:
    ==============
        - The absolute value removes the element completely from its normal flow in the document.
        

    4. CSS fixed Position
    ======================
        - The fixed value positions an element to remain fixed in the same position, even when the page is scrolled. 
        - It is similar to the absolute value, but it remains relative to the viewport at all times.

    5. CSS sticky Position
    ========================
        - The sticky value positions the element as a combination of relative and fixed values.

        - The sticky position behaves like relative positioning until the element reaches a certain scroll point on the screen. 
        - After that, the element sticks to the top of the viewport like a fixed element.
