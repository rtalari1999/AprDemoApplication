## What is Inheritance?
========================

    1. Inheritance is acquiring all the variables and methods from one class to another class.
    2. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes.
          1. Parent class(Super or Base class)
          2. Child class(Subclass or Derived class)
    3. A class which inherits the properties is known as child class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.
    4. Typescript can be extented to to create new classes with inheritance, using the keyword extends.
    5.

    Example:
    =========
        class Animal {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            canFly: boolean;

            constructor(name: string, age: number, canFly: boolean){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                canFly = caFly;
            }
        }

        class Dog extends Animal {
            // class Dog acquires all the properties and methods of class Animal
        }



   ## What is Super keyword in typescript ?
   ========================================
   1. Super keyword is used in classes to call the constructor or access the properties of a parent(superclass).
   2. super keyword must be in forst line inside constructor.
            this = this object(current class)
            super = the parent
   3. if any input parameters are in parent constructor then must pass same order of data type in super as arguments.
   4. super keyword can be used in methods and constructors of child.


   Example:
   ========

    class Animal {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            canFly: boolean;

            constructor(name: string, age: number, canFly: boolean){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                canFly = caFly;
            }
        }

        class Dog extends Animal {
            eat: boolean;
            constructor(name: string, age: number, canFly: boolean, eat:boolean ) {
                super(name, age, canFly, eat);
            }
        }

  ## What if Parent Constructor have parameters ?
   ===============================================

    1. When object is created for child class then we pass argments to the parent constructor 
        OR ELSE
         if we have constructor in child class also with some more extra parameters will send 
         through child class object(instance) and inside constructor super keyword is used to 
         invoke and send data to constructor of a parent.

    2. if any input parameters are in parent constructor then must pass same order of data type in super as arguments.
    3. super keyword can be used in methods and constructors of child.
        Example:
        =========
            class Animal {
                name: string;
                age: number;
                canFly: boolean;

                constructor(name: string, age: number, canFly: boolean){
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                    canFly = caFly;
                }
            }

            class Dog extends Animal {
                eat: boolean;
                constructor(name: string, age: number, canFly: boolean, eat:boolean ) {
                    super(name, age, canFly, eat);
                }
            }
